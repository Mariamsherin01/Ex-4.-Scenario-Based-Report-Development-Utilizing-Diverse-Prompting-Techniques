# Ex-4.-Scenario-Based-Report-Development-Utilizing-Diverse-Prompting-Techniques
Objective: The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation.

One-shot prompting.

Few-shot prompting.

Chain-of-thought prompting.

Role-based prompting.

Contextual prompting.

Instruction-based prompting.

Socratic prompting.

Comparative prompting.

Persona-driven prompting.

3.Design Prompts for Each Technique:

Frame a set of queries a retail customer might ask.

Apply each prompting method to the same queries.

4.Execute Prompts in AI Systems:

Use AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, etc., to test consistency.

5.Collect Outputs:

Document responses generated for each scenario and technique.

6.Analyze Responses:

Compare clarity, accuracy, empathy, personalization, and effectiveness.

7.Document Results:

Report findings in detailed format with comparisons.

8.Conclude:

Summarize which prompting methods deliver the best customer experience.


## Prompt & Output:

Prompts, Outputs, and Results
Scenario 1: Product Inquiry

Customer Question: “Do you have Nike running shoes in size 9?”

(a) Zero-shot Prompting

Prompt: “Answer the customer’s query about product availability.”

Output: “We have Nike running shoes available in various sizes. For size 9, availability depends on current stock. Please check our online catalog or provide your location so I can confirm.”

Result: Response is generic but functional; lacks personalization and real-time stock check.

(b) One-shot Prompting

Prompt: “Example: If a customer asks about iPhone 14 availability, say: ‘Yes, we have it in stock. Would you like delivery or in-store pickup?’ Now, answer this: Do you have Nike running shoes in size 9?”

Output: “Yes, we have Nike running shoes in size 9 available. Would you prefer home delivery or to pick them up in-store?”

Result: Clear and customer-friendly, but assumes stock availability.

(c) Few-shot Prompting

Prompt:

Q: “Do you have Samsung Galaxy S23 in stock?”

A: “Yes, we have it available. Would you like to order now?”

Q: “Can I buy Levi’s jeans in size 32?”

A: “Yes, Levi’s jeans in size 32 are available. Do you prefer pickup or delivery?”

Q: “Do you have Nike running shoes in size 9?”

Output: “Yes, Nike running shoes in size 9 are available. Would you like me to add them to your cart?”

Result: Polished, conversational, and sales-driven response.

(d) Role-based Prompting

Prompt: “You are a friendly retail assistant. Answer the customer politely and helpfully: Do you have Nike running shoes in size 9?”

Output: “Of course! Let me check that for you. Yes, we have Nike running shoes in size 9. Would you like me to show you the available colors?”

Result: Engaging and personalized; makes customer feel valued.

Scenario 2: Order Tracking

Customer Question: “Where is my order #12345?”

(a) Zero-shot Prompting

Prompt: “Track the customer’s order and provide a status update.”

Output: “Your order #12345 is being processed. It will be shipped soon.”

Result: Basic but lacks specific details.

(b) Few-shot Prompting

Prompt:

Q: “Where is my order #98765?”

A: “Your order #98765 has been shipped and is on the way. Expected delivery is 2 days.”

Q: “Where is my order #12345?”

Output: “Your order #12345 has been shipped and will be delivered by tomorrow evening.”

Result: Detailed and reassuring to the customer.

(c) Role-based Prompting

Prompt: “You are a customer care representative. Provide an empathetic and helpful answer: Where is my order #12345?”

Output: “I understand you want an update on your order. Order #12345 has been dispatched and is expected to arrive tomorrow. Thank you for your patience!”

Result: Empathetic tone improves customer trust.

Scenario 3: Return/Refund Policy

Customer Question: “Can I return a product if I don’t like it?”

(a) Instruction-based Prompting

Prompt: “Explain the return policy clearly in two sentences.”

Output: “Yes, you can return products within 30 days of purchase if you are not satisfied. Please ensure the product is unused and in its original packaging.”

Result: Concise and informative.

(b) Socratic Prompting

Prompt: “Ask guiding questions to help the customer understand return eligibility.”

Output: “Did you purchase the product within the last 30 days? Is the product unused and in its original packaging? If yes, then you are eligible for a return.”

Result: Interactive, but may frustrate customers who want direct answers.

Scenario 4: Troubleshooting

Customer Question: “My coffee maker is not working, what should I do?”

(a) Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Prompt: “Think step by step. Help the customer troubleshoot a coffee maker.”

Output: “First, check if the power cable is properly plugged in. Next, ensure the water tank has enough water. Then, verify that the coffee filter is correctly placed. If it still doesn’t work, please contact our support team for repair.”

Result: Logical and structured; guides customer through solution.

(b) Persona-driven Prompting

Prompt: “Act like a technical support expert who explains solutions in a friendly manner.”

Output: “I’m here to help! Please check that the power cord is securely connected. Also, make sure there is enough water in the tank and the filter is in place. If it still doesn’t brew, don’t worry—our support team can assist you further.”

Result: Balances technical accuracy with friendliness.

## Result:

From this experiment, we can see that different prompting techniques create significant variations in chatbot performance:

Zero-shot prompting produces functional but generic answers, often lacking depth.

One-shot and few-shot prompting improve quality by learning from examples, creating more natural and polished responses.

Role-based and persona-driven prompting stand out by adding empathy, friendliness, and human-like interaction, which improves customer satisfaction.

Chain-of-thought prompting is most effective for step-by-step troubleshooting scenarios.

Instruction-based prompting is best for clear, concise explanations such as return/refund policies.

Socratic prompting is useful for guiding the customer but can sometimes be less user-friendly.

Conclusion: The best-performing chatbot for a retail environment would combine few-shot prompting (for accuracy and context), role-based prompting (for empathy), and chain-of-thought prompting (for troubleshooting). Together, these techniques ensure the chatbot is helpful, human-like, and reliable.
